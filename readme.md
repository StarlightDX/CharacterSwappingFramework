## Character Swapping Framework
The Character Swapping Framework is a mod that allows you to have custom slots in game in which to switch character (model & voice) in a single click.

## CSF ToolKit
To use the CSF ToolKit, put your AR files into the input folder, run any of the relevant batch scripts, then in the packing folder, run AR0Pack.bat to pack all the folders. Only take what you need, i.e. AR files with nothing inside should be deleted. Then just put these files into your stage mod.

If you were unsure about what files were needed or not, or skipped that step, please prefix with the append format, "+" at the start of the archives for AR and ARL.

## LAW ToolKit
Please refer to above on how to use but there is one important difference, your result files need to be append AR, this means you need to prefix the AR & ARL with "+" at the start.
If you don't do this you will break LAW content in your night stage which would also crash your stage.
